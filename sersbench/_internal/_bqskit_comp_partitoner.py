    Replicates ForEachBlockPass 

    Parameters:
        qc (str): Quantum circuit to be optimized. Path directory to QASM file.

        pass_type (int): Optimization algorithm to use. Supports QSearch and LEAP. 0 for QSearch, 1 for LEAP. (Default: 0).

        partitioner (int): Partitions circuit into blocks of 3 qubits. Supports ScanPartitioner and QuickPartitioner. 0 for
        ScanPartitioner and 1 for QuickPartitioner. (Default: 0).

        success_threshold (float): The distance threshold that determines successful termintation. (Default: 1e-8).

        save_path (str): The fie path to save the string to. (Default: None).

        replace_filter (str): A predicate that determines if the resulting circuit, after calling loop_body on a block, 
        should replace the original operation. (Default: 'always'). Support for 'less-than', 'always', and 'less-than-multi'. 


    Returns:
        Optimized circuit, the name of the circuit, the number of gates in each partition before optimization, the number of gates
        in each partition after optimization, the number of 2-qubit gates in each partition before optimization, and the number of 
        two-qubit gates in each partition after optimization. If there is a valid save_path, saves compiled circuit to save_path.
